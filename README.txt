jQuery migrate
==============

This Drupal 7 module adds jQuery migrate plugin to avoid javascripts errors with
newer versions of jQuery. This module is meant to be used in combination with
jquery_update module.

This module lets you:

I. Choose where to add migrate plugin: admin pages only, frontend pages only, both or none.
II. Insert minfied or normal migrate plugin javascript file.

Out of the box, Drupal 7 ships with an old jquery version. If you use jquery update
module and you have jQuery errors this module is meant for you! You may not need to
find more patches for jQuery bugs for every module!
